                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        I am Li Jiaxin, a 22-year-old young Chinese woman, But you can call me YouYuan, this is the name that I took for myself, it represents the beginning of everything, the start point. I took this name for myself because I hope that I can always keep the
                        original intention and not forget the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        When I was very young, from the beginning of my memory, I lived with my aunt and grandma. My mother was often out of the house because of work and my dad didn't want to take me with him even though we live in the same city. I didn't know why. But how
                        my dad treated me didn't matter to me when I was young. Because my grandmother gave me care and love, and my aunt gave me company and fun. I thought that’s enough for me.</p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        The earliest picture in my memory is that I finished my meal every afternoon around five thirty, and grabbed the small bench and sat to wait for the TV to broadcast the cartoon channel. My auntie hadn’t gone off work yet, and my grandma grabbed another
                        small bench just next to me to accompany me. we waited together.I waited a long time, until the light outside the window changed from light yellow like scrambled eggs to orange like sausage. Finally my One Hundred and One Dalmatians
                        came on. In the sunset, I was angry because the bad woman was going to bully the dogs again. I was so angry that I rolled around on the ground. My grandma helped me up and told me that it was just a story. In fact, dogs are so
                        cute so everyone loves dogs. No one is going to bully any of them. I thought : yeah, that makes sense, and I didn’t feel angry anymore because I believed in my grandma.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        In fact, my aunt still has a lot of discipline in me, but my grandmother totally spoiled me, and felt that I should be spoiled no matter what I do, even if what I do is willful and naive from an adult's point of view.
                    </p>

                    <p class="desc">
                        Once I couldn't stop crying, because my mother, whom I had not seen for a long time, was going on a business trip again and I hoped she would stay. Grandma knew that mom had to go because that's her work so she hugged me. She let my head be buried in
                        her arms and let my mom go. It was a long time after my mother left that she finally let me go. I felt so uncomfortable and hated her for preventing me from going to my mother, I hoped my mother could bring me with her to work.
                        But grandma stopped me from chasing her. So I kept using all my strength to kick her and beat her. She didn't fight back, but looked at me sad and worried with her gentle and cloudy eyes, worried that my mother's departure would
                        bring me too much pain. I had been crying for a long, long time, and finally I leaned on the radiator and sobbed. Seeing that I was too weak to cry, my grandmother went to the kitchen and made me a big bowl of instant noodles (she
                        can't cook, and only serves instant noodles).
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        The soup was so full that it was about to overflow the rim of the bowl, so she held the porcelain bowl with both hands balancing it, and moved her feet to me in small steps, saying, "Hurry up, baby, come get your favorite instant noodles!". then I took
                        a look. I was really hungry. The instant noodles smelled so good, and a white and tender poached egg was looming in the soup. However, I thought in my mind: I'm still angry! Does she think I will not be angry anymore just because
                        of this temptation! Why does she despise my anger, my anger is so great!” Thinking of this, I kicked over the bowl in my grandma's hands. It spilled into grandma's arms and then scattered all over the place. Fortunately, it was
                        winter, and my grandmother didn't get burned while wearing thick cotton clothes. She looked at the mess on the ground, but had no complaint. She just sighed and said: I will make you another one. She quietly cleaned up the broken
                        tiles and leftovers on the ground. I watched and felt so guilty, but I still couldn't apologize and help. I had no choice but to remain silent as I watched her crouching and rushing back and forth, just because of my silly and
                        strange pride that came from nowhere.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        After entering elementary school, I was picked up by my parents to live with them. My aunt was young and in good health and she often came to play with me at the house. She often took me out to listen to concerts, go bowling and do lots of other activities.
                        But grandma was not willing to leave the apartment, not only because of her bad health, but also for other reasons. She was really reluctant and relied on my aunt to buy food and cooking, and hardly ever went out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        In my memory, she was forced by my mother to travel out of our province with all of us only twice, and she would resist in every way before the journey started. She even cursed my mother and my aunt who just wanted to take her out for fun. Although she
                        usually had a bad face during our travels, even when taking pictures, I felt that sometimes she was strangely happy. She still behaved as if she was upset, but I could feel that she was actually a little happy from her eyes and
                        attitudes ---- I guess she must have suppressed her true emotions for the sake of pride like I did when I kicked the noodle when I was a kid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        In my impression, the one action that she always does is to sit in the corner of the sofa and smoke slowly. She must smoke a cigarette brand called "Good Cat". The cigarette box is dark blue with its logo and name printed on it with golden embossing technique.
                        Its logo is very cute. It's a cat. <span class="png">
                            <img src="./images/1.jpg" alt="">
                        </span> When I was a kid, I didn't have much entertainment except cartoons every afternoon. I often stroked the logo and imagined what kind of cat it was as a special activity for killing the endless spare time.

                    </p>


                    <p class="desc">My grandma is so addicted to cigarettes, sitting there every day, looking at the air in a daze, her eyes are loose, just smoking one by one. With twenty per pack of "Good Cat" cigarettes, she can smoke more than one pack a day. In
                        the corner where my grandma often sits, the ceiling and the wall next to her have been smoked to dark brown color. The color spreads around the corner where she is, gradually spreading to light yellow. At that time in my eyes,
                        she was someone who was holding the cigarette and being surrounded by a layer of black mist. The mist seemed to come from all corners of the world, wrapping her around, holding her tightly, so that she had to sit there and couldn’t
                        move.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">But there was a moment that allowed her some free time from the black mist. Whenever the hand of the watch is about to point to five o'clock, grandma will stand up and stare at the watch, her right hand holding the cigarette is hanging
                        in the air, her left hand is in the waist, her face is motionless and nervous, her eyes are big and muddy. Staring at the watch as if staring at the prey, she seems to be casted a holding spell. And when the minute hand finally
                        pointed to twelve, she would suddenly raise her hands above her head with a genuine smile on her face and shout, "Chairman Mao is back! Chairman Mao is back!!" It was like a weird ritual.</p>
                    <p class="desc">As a young person, I think this behavior is a bit weird, but I have limited cognition so I can't say anything wrong from it. I get used to it over time. Then grandma looked at the door with a big smile, I don't know what she was waiting
                        for, maybe she was waiting for "Chairman Mao". But after a while, she seemed to realize something, and gradually put her smile away, and her eyelids drooped again to cover the light that was rarely seen just now. "Huh, he is not
                        a good thing." I often hear her say this. I sat on the small bench next to the TV and watched her sitting back on the corner of the sofa, continuing to smoke, breathing in the dark mist, and sinking into the dark room.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Frankly speaking, grandma has mental illness. This is something that should not be told to others in our culture. This is the information I collected from the conversations between my family and relatives. When I was ignited and curious
                        and wanted to inquire further, I was always scolded, "You kid, don't ask this!" Then they would turn around their talking bluntly, or being silent for a long time. The heavy and solemn atmosphere they exude at this moment made
                        me feel breathless. Although I have always been curious, I never dared to ask anymore, as if my inquiry would lead to any serious consequences, and as if I was searching for an incredible secret.</p>
                    <p class="desc">I graduated from high school and received an acceptance letter from the United States. At the age of 17, I embarked on an unknown journey alone. No one was by my side. But I felt that I was a lonely warrior. Although timid, I was more
                        excited and thrilled. When I was in college, I felt that my focus of life gradually shifted to school. I stay with my friends every day, and there are always various clubs and activities on weekends. I enjoy the joy of youth and
                        the tension brought by deadlines, but these days, I rarely think of my home. I rarely call home, even though I already have a video call function on my phone at that time. Every time my mother or my aunt calls me after cautiously
                        calculating the jet lag, I always feel that they are delaying me and just hang up after a few rounds. Even various holidays are filled with internships and travels with friends, and I only went home twice within five years during
                        bachelor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">I was dragged by my mother to see my grandma during those two periods of homecoming. To me, she seems to be a person far away from my life at that time. We are separated by the river of time. I can see her but I don't want to cross
                        the river. When I grew up, I didn't know how to be ignorant anymore. I realized that she was really a bit strange, but as for the reason? I didn't have access to explore it and didn't want to dig into it. I thought, "It doesn't
                        matter, my life can be without her story anyway".</p>
                    <p class="desc">In the two meetings with her, she still acts like what I have remembered, smoking a "good cat" cigarette in the corner of the sofa. Only glanced up at us when we greeted her and then she lowered her head and stared at the floor again,
                        then never moved.</p>
                    <p class="desc">At this time, my auntie was married and moved into a new house with her husband. Only my grandmother lived in this old apartment. The apartment that has existed for more than 30 years and it is a bit dilapidated, and even the smokiness
                        on the wall and ceiling in my impression is deeper, darker, and the darkest areas are even a little shiny. My grandma in this mist also seemed to be darker, her whole person huddled and curled up as if being sucked by the black
                        mist.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">Her lumbar spine is very bad that she can only bend over and put her elbows against her thighs to smoke: Although she knows that this will make her condition worse, she still chooses to drink this poison to quench her thirst, in order
                        to take that smoke. After my mother and my aunt talked a lot for a long time, with the intention of trying to let her join the conversation but failed --- my grandma didn’t respond. My mother and my aunt had to leave the old apartment
                        with me. Before stepping out of the door, I turned my head and looked at her, her face was in the smoke. The blurry and distortion because of the smoke made me hardly see her clearly,What I can clearly saw was only her muddy eyes,
                        they were still looking at a point near me, expressing confusion and sadness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc"> And that was the last time I saw her.</p>

                        <span>PHASE 1: DENIAL</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        In March 2020, I was panicked because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic in the United States. In New York, I have no intention of doing anything every day. I only keep refreshing the real-time data of New York diagnoses on the Internet.
                        I don’t want to go to school but I have to because the school does not have any policies on this yet and I want to graduate. Because of my family's advice and the severe domestic epidemic situation in China, I dare not go out without
                        wearing a mask. On the train, every time I wear a mask, I receive some unfriendly eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        I was very impressed one day. That night, I was still anxious and tired after a class and set off to take the PATH TRAIN back to my apartment in Jersey City. On the train, I was scolded for wearing a mask by a big guy. What he said was terrible. At the
                        time, I didn't dare to refute or cause conflict in a foreign country. In order not to let him see my cowardice, I had to put my head down, pretending that I didn't understand what he said. I think he can actually tell that I can
                        understand, so he keeps talking, but I really can't think of any other way to deal with such a situation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        Listening to his harsh words along the way, my tears rolled in my eyes, my head buzzed, my hands in my clothes pockets clenched into fists, my nails were deep in the flesh, and it hurts, but these pains also helped me won’t let the tears fall. He is a
                        very strong man. He stood opposite me and said excitedly. With my head down, I could only see his chest. The carriage was very quiet, except for his voice and the sound of the ding-ding-dong subway running. I secretly glanced at
                        the people nearby, and everyone looked like nothing happened, just seeing straight. so I had to look at the ground again.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">The journey that day was exceptionally long, so long that I felt that there was a long interval between my breaths. Amid his verbal abuse, I thought of the loneliness I felt during the time I came to New York. Every day I spent a long
                        commute to and from school by myself. There are a lot of things that I have never encountered before in terms of academics, and lots of inconvenience in life. The scenes hovered in my mind, making me feel so depressed. I tried
                        to keep my eyes open widely, trying to evaporate some tears by this way, but the tears still accumulated more and more. Fortunately, the train door opened, and I turned my head and flew away from the train. I was afraid that the
                        man would catch me up.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Fortunately, he probably just wanted to scold me along the way back home and didn't intend to catch up to me. When I ran, I seemed to hear his disdainful laugh. But anyway, I finally escaped the terrible scene. I took a long breath
                        and dragged heavy steps back to the apartment. After greeting my roommate with a smile like usual, I went back to my room and closed the door, lying weakly on the bed in a daze. There is no light on the ceiling. I only bought a
                        small lamp in order to save money. Even if the lamp is turned on at night, the room is still dim. The gray ceiling in my eyes while lying on the bed gradually became blurry. And I stayed in this vague vision for a long time, and
                        my consciousness began to blur as well, not knowing the passage of time, until I was interrupted by the ringtone of the mobile phone.</p>
                    <p class="desc">It was my mother's video call. I looked at the screen and suddenly realized that she hadn't called me on video for a long time. I quickly took a deep breath and took some napkins to wipe away my tears, changed into a nonchalant look
                        and clicked accept, "Oh, what's the matter, you haven’t called me for a long time, I thought you already forgot your kid?" I joked. But my mom didn’t laugh because of the joke. She said with a solemn expression different from the
                        past, "Jiaxin, grandma passed away". I asked "Ah? What's going on? Why?" She didn't answer my question. She just said that she is very busy now and there are a lot of things that she needs to deal with. She just informs me of the
                        fact now, she will tell me more detail when she gets any chance. She asked me if I want to consider returning to China for my grandma. After that, she hung up.</p>
                    <p class="desc">I released the phone and started looking at the ceiling in a daze---and this time seemed more dazed than before. After a long time, my vision became blurred again, and at this time, I felt as if something was pressed against my chest,
                        making me want to scream and release. I thought, where can I let myself cry?</p>
                    <p class="desc">Now my roommate is at home, so I must not cry in the room, and although this apartment is newly built, the soundproofing is very poor, and the sound of cooking next door can often be heard. If I cry loudly, it will disturb the neighbors
                        next door. The Common Room in the building is obviously not a good choice. If crying outside the apartment, will I be scolded again or even beaten? And is there a chance to get the virus if I take off the mask when crying? and
                        If I cry on the street, I’m going to disturb others..... I thought about it and found that I couldn’t find any place to let me relax and release my emotions. My roommate was watching the TV show loudly next door, and the laughter
                        from time to time poured into my ears. I had to open my mouth and scream silently in her laughter, like a goldfish falling on the ground, staring to a point, open mouth as big as I can and try to catch a little bit of oxygen for
                        survival.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">I was too tired because of crying, then I just fell asleep. When I woke up the next day, I felt that my sanity had recovered a bit, and I could finally start thinking and reasoning. Yesterday my mother said that my grandma had passed
                        away. Is this true? What is the situation like? I really want to know what's going on. But yesterday I felt my mother was very stressed, so I dare not stimulate her anymore. Although the relationship between me and my father has
                        always been estranged, maybe he is the most suitable choice for me to ask at this moment.</p>
                    <p class="desc">So I sent him a message and asked him, "My mother said that my grandma passed away yesterday, is it true?" He only replied with a few words "It is true, we are in the hospital,will you come back?" For a while, I was a little confused.
                        I can't believe it, this is the first time I have encountered the death of someone close to me. The hand holding the phone began to tremble, and I think my voice was a little trembling as well. I recorded the voice note and asked
                        him if he was lying, but before I finished that voice message, I cried out and cancelled that message. I realize it must be true, they won’t take this kind of serious thing as a joke, I don’t want to cheat myself anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">I found grandma’s WeChat account --- my mother once registered a WeChat account for grandma and added a group of friends and relatives, and repeatedly taught grandma how to use it (though I think grandma probably never listened to
                        it), and told her that it is a good way to using this to contact others. The chatting box between me and her was empty, no message was displayed. I looked at this empty dialog box, and suddenly had the urge to send a message to
                        my grandma. Why? Actually, I didn’t know it myself. I posted, "Grandma, long time no see, I’ve had a hard time recently, how about you?" I didn’t want to read it again after sending this message, so I hurriedly turned off the phone,
                        as if I was running away from something.</p>
                    <p class="desc">After a short period of thought, I decided to go home. Even if I found that it was difficult to buy a ticket to return to my country, even if the ticket cost was almost ten times more expensive than usual and I had to be quarantined
                        after returning to my country, I did not change my mind.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Finally, I bought a flight ticket from New York to Tokyo, Japan back to Xiamen in five days. After the quarantine, I still need to fly back to my home city for another quarantine. I was very excited that I finally grabbed the possibility
                        of going home after a long time refreshing the official flight websites. After getting the flight order confirmation, I couldn’t wait to take out my mobile phone and send WeChat to my grandma, “Grandma, I’m coming back soon!!”
                        Strangely speaking, I didn’t think of my grandma very often before her death, and she was not someone I wanted to share happiness with at first moment, but this time, the person I wanted to tell the good news to was her. Perhaps
                        I think of her so frequently these days so I have deepened my connection with her.</p>
                    <p class="desc">The rest of the day passed in a muddle-headed manner. There was nothing in my mind, but a step-by-step implementation according to the plan. I felt like my body was light and fluttering like cotton, and my head was stuffy as if it
                        was wrapped in a plastic bag. Even the voices from the outside world heard deep echoes in my ears. I didn’t cry anymore, I just felt that I lost my ability to perceive emotions. The upheaval of the journey and the long isolation
                        did not tear the plastic bag that wrapped me until I returned to my familiar home after a long time. The plastic bag was pulled by the warm atmosphere of home, tearing a hole for me to breathe. Colors and sounds gradually emerged
                        in my originally silent mind.</p>
                    <p class="desc">It was my aunt who came to pick me up. She said that my mother was thinking of picking me up, but she saw that my mother was not in a good mood and didn't take much rest, so she said she would pick me up instead. Although she said
                        that, I saw her dark circles under her eyes and drooping eyebrows, I knew that she might not be very well either.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">When I got home, it was already evening, and she said I should take a good bath and rest for the night and she will pick me up for the funeral tomorrow morning. After an exhortation, she helped me unpack my luggage, then she went back
                        to the funeral parlor to help.</p>
                    <p class="desc">That night, I lay alone in the huge house tossing and turning.</p>

                        <p class="desc">
                            I opened the glass door and looked at the sky. Perhaps because of pollution, the starry sky is no longer as luxuriant in my memory when I was a child, and only a few scattered stars were left in the stark sky, even the originally dark blue sky that revealed
                            the tranquility became gray.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">It turns out that so many changes have taken place during the time I was away, and even the sky that I thought would never change no longer exists. So many stars are now far away from me; probably, grandma is one of them.</p>
                        <p class="desc">I leaned against the door, blowing in the wind, no longer looking up at the sky. I think this is because the stars are temporarily invisible because of pollution, they are still themselves, they still exist. As time goes by, I
                            think I will see the stars again, just like I can see my grandma again.</p>
                        <p class="desc">Suddenly, I felt a trace of relief.</p>

                    <div class="downdesc">
                        <p class="desc">I opened the familiar interface.I often opened the chat interface with my grandma recently. Not every time do I say anything, maybe it's because I've been living in a mess during this period of time, maybe it's because I have too
                            many thoughts to talk about. Most of the time I just stared at this interface, my mind was full of memories of my grandma, just like my current state.</p>
                        <p class="desc">I think of the white gauze princess dress she bought me when I was a child. I remembered how she protected me and got angry at my aunt after my aunt scolded me. I remembered the many bowls of instant noodles she gave me… I thought
                            a lot until the screen was wet with tears that I came back to my senses.</p>
                        <p class="desc">I wiped my tears, typed "Grandma, I miss you so much" on the screen, and clicked send.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">I looked at the small green squares on the right side of the screen, and there was no dialog box on the left. I told myself that my grandma could not use the phone yet and would not reply. She was watching. One day, after she learns
                            how to operate her mobile phone, she will reply to me!</p>

                            There is no wave in the air, as if time has stopped, and I am the only thing that can move and change in this space. The wind outside the window sounded distant and deep, as if it came from a cave. All this brings me a rare feeling, I feel that I can
                            do everything I want to do in this space, without worrying about the way others look at me, worrying about whether it will disturb others, or pretending that nothing happened. Be myself.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">I suddenly realized the freedom that this place brings to me, and my long-repressed emotions can be vented here. So I lay down on the floor without any scruples as I wanted, pounding the floor and crying bitterly. My mouth wide
                            open, I can finally let out a miserable howl, letting my nose run and tears flow.</p>
                        <p class="desc">I feel that I have been crying for a long time. Although I didn't look at the time, it was the longest cry in my memory. I called out all the grievances, regrets, anger, and anxiety in my life to the world. I looked at the surrounding
                            furniture, their shadowy silhouettes also looked like they were overlooking from a high place, looking at me with sympathetic eyes, which contained sorrow and doubt, just like the last time my grandma looked at me.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">Lying on the ground, I looked at the shadow of the tall furniture. They looked like solemn and loving old people, they all had the same grandma's eyes. Perhaps, grandma is not as lonely as I thought, right? She would meet someone
                            similar to her in that world. Some peers who can understand her. Maybe she will be happier than she was alive, right?</p>

                    <p class="desc">
                        The next day I was shaken by my aunt. "Get up soon, it’s time to go to the funeral!" I got dizzy and held my head when I awakened. I thought about so many things last night and my head hurt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        On the way to the funeral home, there was no silence as I imagined. My aunt’s mouth kept talking, maybe she was also very afraid of silence at this time. She said that they told the funeral home to keep the body for a while so that I could see my grandma
                        when I came back. The deadline is approaching today. Fortunately, I came back as planned and there were no surprises. She told me that she and lots of relatives arranged the memorial overnight, and grandma finally can be cremated
                        today. She told me she feared that it would be bad for grandma's corpse If it stayed too long… She really talks a lot.I am still full of questions about my grandma’s death reason, but I can see that my aunt is in a very low mental
                        status and deliberately avoiding this topic, so I think I should just wait for the right time and find a chance to ask, so I just passively responded to my aunt along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        Finally arrived at the funeral parlour, and colors in my eyes suddenly turned into black. All decorations are in black, the black-and-white photos of grandmother placed in the center. The photo was taken when she was eating and her tongue was still exposed.
                        I asked my aunt about this picture, and she said that this is the only clear single-person picture that grandma seems happy that she can find. There are not many photos of her. Haha, I looked at that photo and thought it was so
                        cute, the photo adding a hint of sunshine to my gloomy mood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        When I finally walked through the long process and talked with guests, I felt exhausted after clearing up the mess. When I finally sent away all the guests and friends, only left my dear aunts and my parents, I finally planned to ask the question: "How
                        did grandma leave?". After the voice fell, the depressive atmosphere enveloped us, and the atmosphere was so quiet that even when a needle dropped to the ground could be clearly heard. I also waited silently for the bravest one
                        of them to answer my question. After a while, maybe very long, maybe very short, I heard my mother say: "It's because of a cerebral hemorrhage."
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        I immediately followed her reply and asked eagerly: "How could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? If a cerebral hemorrhage onset, all her needs are a good rest, then it will be fine. Why don't you just let her take a rest?!" Auntie's dull voice came over: "It
                        was my bad, she was too tired because of taking care of my child NanNan, your cousin." My mother raised her head and called my aunt's full name angrily: "Chang Rong, you are really shameless! If you don't bring your own child to
                        ask my mom to take care, my mother won’t be exhausted!" My aunt was flushed with anger or shame, I cannot tell , with tears in her eyes, she suddenly lowered her head and wiped the tears with her arms. I was a little surprised
                        at this fact, and opened my eyes to digest this information. And my mother stared at my aunt with red eyes, still chattering: " it's all your fault！ My mother already felt very uncomfortable in the end, but she didn’t take any
                        rest because of worried that if she took rest then no one was going to take care of your child. So she held that pain to knock on the neighbors to beg the neighbor to look after your child, and then she just fell down. If she felt
                        uncomfortable and just went to rest as before, Today’s everything won’t happen! She will still be fine! Don’t you think you are the sinner of my mom’s death?" Aunt opened her eyes with tears and weakly wanted to refute "But that
                        day our mother insisted on helping me with the baby..." Before the next words came out, mom yelled back, "Our mother was sick. Don’t you know? Do you have to let her take your baby after she asks? Why are you so lazy?! Everything
                        is because you are so fond of eating and averse to work, so that you killed my mother!" Aunt stopped abruptly with unspoken words, she knew she always cannot win my mother in debate aspects. She can only bite her lip and shrink
                        her nose, then lower her head to look at the ground again with wide open eyes. Looks a bit dissatisfied and aggrieved but can only choose to accept. And my mother continued to blame aunt. I realize that everyone’s status is a bit
                        wrong. So I said:

                            a little, and she no longer yells at me. Instead, he said, "Forget it, I'm the only person worrying about everything . You guys don't care about all the work and I have to do it all. I don't care what you do. Don’t bother me
                            anymore" After that, she left the meeting.

                            My mother seemed angry that she began to snort: "Oh, you can't tell who your mother is, right? You are very close to your aunt, aren’t you? You even helped her to scold me? You are such a good daughter! " Her reason seemed to be a little bit further bewildered
                            by her emotion, she began to laugh, and shouted into the air: "Mom! Look at these people! They killed you and want to piss me off! Mom, why don't you take me with you." She squatted on the ground and pulled her hair.

                            I wanted to stop her self-abuse action but was being pushed away by her fierce wave of arms, she said loudly, "Don't touch me". I looked at my aunt, she still lowered her head and didn't look at anyone, as if she was ignorant of everything that happened
                            to us. My dad grabbed me and said, "leave here and let your mother be quiet"

                        <img src="./images/arrow.png" alt=""> Auntie, you are going too far. You clearly know that grandma is not in good health, so how can you let her do such a tiring task like raising a child!

                            The moment I blurted out this sentence, I regretted it. My aunt looked sad enough, why should I put more pressure on her?
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Auntie raised her head and looked at me,surprisingly, her expression was not as excited as before. She said, "Jiaxin, you have to speak with your conscience. Am I not good to you and your grandma? Is your grandma's death what I want? Do you know how much
                            I blame myself?" She didn't look at me after she said it. Then she didn't look at me or my mom, just hurriedly said: "Brother-in-law, I'll go out first" to my dad and left. My dad was smoking a cigarette and said, "Hey, it's
                            dark now, don't go too far, NanNan will feel bad if you hurt yourself." My aunt responded and staggered away.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I glanced at my dad. I didn't expect him to be this affectionate, knowing to mention my cousin, make my auntie have this concern, so that my aunt won't do any drastic actions anymore. I secretly blamed myself, knowing that what I said just now was very
                            harmful to my aunt, but because my mother was still here, it was difficult for me to chase out and apologize to my aunt to change my position. Had to give up.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            We stayed temporarily in a hotel near the funeral home, and I almost stayed up all night because of what happened last night, and felt very uncomfortable. I guessed that my question would be difficult for them to answer, but I didn't expect it to cause
                            barriers and harm.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Despite the quarrel that broke out last night, everyone gathered in the funeral home the next day. Today is a very important day. Grandma's body will be cremated today. From now on, grandma's body will never be recovered. I watched my grandma's coffin
                            slowly enter the pitch-dark cremation furnace. My aunt suddenly knelt down and cried kowtow until grandma’s corpse can’t be seen . At that moment, I felt sorry for my aunt. I looked at her figure, and couldn’t help crying.
                            At that time, I felt that my chin was twitching uncontrollably, but after almost ten seconds, I suddenly calmed down. There was no special feeling, I just felt that my brain was blank. A line of us waited outside the cremation
                            room, surrounded by a hustle and bustle of all kinds of people, most of them were crying bitterly, and some were tearing and blaming each other. I looked at the various sad expressions of so many of them, but I couldn't see
                            any waves in my heart, I just felt noisy. As if what I saw was just the disappearance of another creature.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            After waiting for about an hour, the staff came out with the ashes in their hands. A piece of white mixed with dots of black. Our whole family just watched the two staff ask us to bring part of the ashes for us to take back for burial. Later, according
                            to the custom of our hometown, The cremated remains must be stored in the funeral home until the cemetery is found. I watched my grandma’s ashes being taken away by the staff and placed in a small dark room. I watched the vase
                            gradually go away, remembering that when we last met, did my grandma watch us go in the same way? Did she want to call us back like I do now, but hold back, knowing that the other side will not stop leaving anyway?

                        <span>PHASE 3：BARGAINING AND DEPRESSION</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        After a lot of formalities and troublesome negotiations, my mother finally bought a suitable cemetery niche. It was a beautiful place, in line with the traditional Chinese yin and yang Feng Shui requirements, with its back leaning on the mountain and
                        facing a lake. When the sky came down, the lake was shimmering, and the lush forest on the mountain was blown by the wind, creating a sound of friction and play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        On that day, grandma's ashes were placed in the cemetery, aunt was still crying, but mom was unusually expressionless. I am very worried about her. So on the drive home from the cemetery, my dad drove in front, and I held my mother's hand in the back
                        and asked her what happened. She remained silent at the beginning, but I kept asking. She scolded me, saying I have mental illness, but I knew she was still pretending, so I insisted, "What's wrong with you, tell me, I don't want
                        to see you force yourself like this", she froze. After a while, the shell on her body suddenly shattered. She collapsed suddenly, whimpering and speaking in a very low voice. There is no logic in what she said. I can only understand
                        what she wants to express from her words and Dad's supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        It turned out that grandma was taken to the hospital by an ambulance that day, and my mother was the first family member who rushed there. At that time, my grandmother's condition was no longer good, and the doctor suggested to give up the resuscitation.
                        Because the best timing has been missed, the best result is that there is about 30% of the possibility of keeping the vegetative status and waiting for a miracle, even if it is a full rescue. My mother was alone in the hospital
                        and there was no one to discuss it with, she just felt that of course she had to save her! Must be saved! That's her mother! So she told the doctor, asking them to try their best to bring her back, for any amount of money, as long
                        as there is a glimmer of hope, she will grab that!
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">However, I also know what happened later, grandma was still not rescued. What I didn’t see, but my mother saw was when grandma was in the ICU, she was naked, lying one the bed like some kind of animal. Her throat was cut and the tube
                        was inserted, chest was cut and the tube was inserted, tummy was cut and the tube was inserted, and even the lower body was inserted into the tube . Almost all of her body was cut up and down, naked without any dignity. Collapsed
                        on the bed. My mother started crying in my arms. She said that if it were not for her obsession, or for her selfish hope that grandma would not leave, grandma would have not had to suffer so much. How painful it must have been...
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc"> I hugged my howling mother, thinking in my heart, she was just a little girl who had just lost her mother and was full of self-blame...
                    </p>
                    <p class="desc">
                        In the days that followed, my mother was still so depressed, she didn't eat much, and she couldn't do anything. Although I am sad, seeing my mother like this, I feel that I have to fight and cheer her up. I decided to take my mother to do some activities
                        to help her find a correct way to channel her grief and sorrow for grandma.

                            My mother agreed to this proposal. She felt that when family member passed away, she should gather their belongings so that the person who passed away would not be too worried.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            So we went back to the house where I lived when I was a child. the smoke-blacked place no longer exists. Mom said that they couldn't stand it anymore and repainted the wall. But all the remaining furnishings are still as before as I remembered.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I helped clean up, picking up pieces of memory fragments in this long-lost room:
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            When I was in elementary school, I was obsessed with embroidering cross-stitch. One time when I went to visit my grandma's house on a weekend, I gave her the first cross-stitch I embroidered. Today, I saw that small bag again. It was already kind of yellowing
                            because of age, and the left side was obviously cracked. She used the blue thread to patch it up again. It seemed that she cherished it. She walked away too suddenly, leaving no words behind. I put the small bag in my pocket
                            and prepared to burn it to her the next time sweeping tomb.

                            I also found the last red envelope for the Spring Festival that my grandma left me in the drawer. Because I am not home every Chinese New Year, she always put the red envelope in this drawer and waited for me to pick it up when I had time to come back.
                            Fortunately, I didn't use money in it yet. I kept this little money, and when I held it in my hand, I felt that my grandmother treated me as nice as she was when I was a child. It felt like she never walked far away.

                            An umbrella was found in a corner of the closet. It was the item that impressed me the most that day. I feel very strange, because this umbrella has never appeared in my memory. My mother said that she knew it, when my grandma was young, my grandfather
                            took her to Great Eastern, a big shopping mall at that time, and bought it. That umbrella was expensive back then; grandma didn't hold it even once, and wrapped it in a newspaper like a baby.

                        </p>


                        <p class="desc">
                            I became silent when I heard this. From my childhood till now, no one has ever mentioned grandpa. I gradually realized that mentioning him was also a taboo in the family, so I never asked. But I vaguely think that he must be related to grandma's mental
                            illness. Otherwise, everyone would not be so secretive.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            This time my mother took the initiative to mention it. I think this might be a good opportunity to ask about my grandpa. So I asked, "It's been so long, can you tell me about grandpa?" Although this sentence was vague, my mother certainly knew that I
                            was referring to the stories of grandma and grandpa over the years. She looked at me with a calm expression. "You have grown up, it's probably time to tell you that." So the long-lost past will finally reveal its mystery to
                            me. At that time, I felt like I had been imprisoned in a secret room for more than 20 years. One day, the heavy black walls all around suddenly began to loosen. I wanted to push the surrounding walls because the outside was
                            the truth that I had longed for, but also very scared, afraid of the unknown that I was about to face. But my worry seems to be too late. The loosen walls around have gradually collapsed in response to my mother's voice.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            It turned out that both grandma and grandpa were sent to Qinghai during the Cultural Revolution. Grandma was sent from Xi'an and grandpa from Shanxi to Qinghai to support production. Qinghai is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the
                            least developed places in China. The place where they were assigned was the Qinghai Foundry. At that time, China made every effort to develop the secondary industry. The foundry was a product of the times. At that time, the
                            Qinghai Foundry was like other state-owned factories, located in relatively remote areas and dozens of kilometers away from the nearest town. Basically, all the workers needed for their daily lives can be solved in the factory
                            area, which can be said to be a community where every member has close relationships.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Grandma was an accountant at the only shop in the factory at that time. She was superb with the abacus and won first place in the factory's abacus contest. According to my mother, my beautiful and capable grandma who was single at that time could be said
                            to be in the limelight and no one could compare for a while. Grandpa was a very diligent person, from the production team member he became the production team leader then to the production director. He was also considered a
                            rare young talent in the factory. At that time, my grandmother's leader saw that they were very suitable, and they were both almost at the age of marriage, so he introduced them to each other. They hit it off and got married
                            in less than a year. After marriage, grandma gave birth to four children including my mother and aunt.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            But the estrangement slowly began to appear. There may be a lot of differences between the two of them: Grandpa is a very diligent person. He is the first to go to work in the office every day. Before working hours, he cleans the table and fills the teacup
                            for each colleague, then does cleaning work, then reads the newspaper and waits for work. Mom said that one of the things that impressed her the most about Grandpa was to teach her that no matter what, it is always right to
                            be ten minutes early. At that time, there was no mobile phone. Grandpa always adjusted his watch ten minutes forward so that he would never be late and would not make others feel disrespected. And he is not only like this at
                            work. At home, mom said that grandfather always rushed home from work at noon on weekdays, peeled a pot of potatoes and washed a pot of cabbage for the family of five to make a table of food in time. The dish never changed
                            on weekdays because the potato cabbage stew is quick to make. When the dish is stewing, my grandpa will wash off all the dishes and the cutting board, wipe the stove and mop the floor, never relaxed for a moment. After the
                            family finished eating, he hurried back to work and left finished dishes in the sink which he will clean after work. Until the rest day he can finally find time to cook some different dishes for mother and other children.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            However, grandma seems to have always been a lazy person. Her education is a college degree, and grandfather only has a junior high school diploma. Mom said that she often used this difference in education to belittle grandfather. She didn't take on a
                            lot of housework at home, because the shop where she went to work was far away from home. She always ate with her colleagues and didn't rush home. At that time, she only smoked occasionally, and she smoked because cigarettes
                            were a rarity at the time. She smoked for a little bit of ostentation, but she didn't have much addiction to cigarettes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Grandpa was somewhat dissatisfied with grandma's lazy attitude, and grandma would talk back that grandpa's education is low. In fact, my grandfather was very pained about his low academic qualifications, because he always wanted to be the deputy factory
                            director, but there are age and education restrictions for being a deputy factory director. Because of his academic qualifications, he probably missed the position of deputy director in his life. Therefore, grandpa was very
                            disgusted with grandma's repeated mention of academic qualifications. Under this cycle, a deep communication gap was formed.

                            Until one day, there was an unclear relationship gossip between my grandfather with a production team member in their office spreading in the whole factory. After these rumors spread throughout the factory, it finally reached my grandma's ears. My grandma
                            is someone who with a strong personality, of course, would not sit still. On the day she heard the news, she rushed to grandpa’s office, caught my grandpa and the female production team member and scolded them, and went to
                            the factory director’s office and found the factory director and complained about grandpa’s shameless behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Mom said that at least from her point of view, there wasn’t any story between grandpa and that colleague at the time. At most, grandpa took some special care of her, but they did not have any private interaction. After all, Grandpa's daily schedule is
                            very tight and there is no spare time for him to do this. But after grandma went to the office to make trouble, they seemed to be closer together. Because grandma complained to them everywhere, they seemed to have formed a
                            state of isolation everywhere, which instead made them feel a sense of sympathy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            In this way, things happened for about half a year, and grandma's eyes became more and more hostile when looking at grandpa, and the relationship between grandpa and his colleague grew deeper. One day, they probably had a discussion. Grandpa and the colleague
                            eloped. They went far away, to Beijing, and threw all the children, responsibilities and pressures to grandma without any communication beforehand.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Everyone in the factory knew the whole story, and the gaze towards grandma was mixed with sympathy and gloating. This kind of public opinion pressure suddenly fell on grandma. And the four children she hadn't been taken care of before were still counting
                            on her. The collapse in her heart can be imagined. Fortunately, at this time, my mother had already gone to college, but she was out of town. My mother hurried home after she received a call from her aunt. The picture she saw
                            when she came back home was a mentally broken grandma and three younger brothers and sisters who were at a loss.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Fortunately,my mother is a very strong person. She did not evade responsibility but was thinking about how to solve the problem. First, she took grandma to a nearby hospital for testing. The hospital said that grandmother had schizophrenia and needed
                            to be hospitalized. So my mother endured her grief and took grandma back to the city where she went to school, and placed her in a nearby mental hospital to visit her every weekend. In the next few years, only the eldest aunt
                            was admitted to the university. Auntie ,who is close with me, and uncle did not study well since they were young, and it was also because grandpa was a leader in the factory, and the position at that time could be passed on
                            to his children. They had been waiting for grandpa’s position or work arrangement for them so they never made any other plans for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            My mother said that in the third year after my grandma was hospitalized, my uncle called her and said that because my grandpa ran away, the people in the factory bullied him and my aunt. The job arranged for him was smelting workman, the most painful
                            and tiring work of the whole factory. He couldn’t take it anymore, He hoped my mother could help him. My mother immediately left for Qinghai and saw that my uncle was the only one who was working in the workplace where a high
                            temperature of thousands of degrees. He has to go to wet the sack, put on the sack with water then put coal on the stove with a shovel frequently. He was black and thin. Mother cried when she saw this scene. Because of the
                            traditional patriarchal thinking, uncle has always been a well-known "Chang master" in the entire Qinghai Foundry. At home, he has never done any housework, only been spoiled. Everything in his life was eating, drinking and
                            having fun every day. But look at him now, when he gets tired, he could only doze off on a narrow stool next to the boiler. His face was scalded with soot from time to time. Mom had never seen him as abject as this.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            My mother used a lot of effort to help uncle find a job in the city where she was studying. Fortunately, the state-owned factory was already withering at this time, so people in the factory had no energy to stop it. Mother took care of my youngest auntie
                            who was just 16 years old with her everyday. Finally, this whole family of people settled down.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            At this point, my grandma had been in the mental hospital for a long time, and her condition had gradually been brought under control. No more babbling words, no more smashing things. It's just that she began to be silent for a long time. Only when her
                            children were visiting, did she speak normally, and she was unwilling to communicate with other people.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            After many more years, when mother finally had enough income, she bought a small two-bedroom apartment for grandma to live in. Because my mother had always been renting apartments before and changed places due to various reasons, she was afraid that frequent
                            changes of the environment would adversely stimulate grandma's condition. Only then the place of stories in my memory happens.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Hearing this, I looked at the umbrella. It turned out that she had such a deep obsession with grandpa. It seemed that reminiscing about the story of her and grandpa was the motivation for her to live. The newspaper was yellow and dilapidated, but the
                            umbrella was still in good condition. It's really touching.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Mom’s long story finally came to an end, she exhaled, as if this story had been pressing on her heart for a long time, and today she was finally able to vomit it. Her expression is also lighter. Just the right touch here to bring the chapter to and end.

                            I am a person who likes writing stuff. I always write to my friends during holidays, and I send postcards to the people who I care about when I travel, and I often write diaries --- probably counting as letters to myself. When I thought about doing something
                            for my mother in order to make her feel better, I felt that she was so self-blamed for grandma's pain before leaving, I thought, why on earth did she think so?
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Everyone knows that it takes a lot of money to rescue her mother. She spend so much money to do so because she hopes that grandma can become a miracle and can stay longer in this world where so many people love her. That’s not completely selfish. The
                            reason why she blamed herself was because she felt that she not only had not let the miracle happen, but also caused grandma to suffer a lot of extra pain. But in fact, my grandmother at that time was already brain-dead, and
                            she shouldn't feel the pain anymore. Mother's self-blame actually shouldn't exist, not to mention she being so depressed because of it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I think, at this moment, the only person who can untie the knot of my mother is herself. When I usually write things, I find that if you want to write even just a little bit of logic, the process requires you to figure out what happened in your mind before
                            you can write. And this process can help you think about it from a more neutral and objective perspective. Perhaps, I can help my mother write some letters to grandma, so that she can understand that this matter is not her
                            fault, she has done her best.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I found my mother and said to her, "I want to write a letter to my grandma to burn it over to her, but I think my grandmother would definitely want to receive your letter as well, and I'm lonely writing a letter by myself. Can you be together with me?"
                            . Mom seemed interested, so I hurriedly arranged papers and pens for her, afraid that she would regret it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            "But, what should I write?" Mom asked me, she didn't have the habit of writing things like me. "Everything is okay", I replied to her "I am going to write to her whatever I want to tell her". After a while, I saw that she hadn’t even started writing,
                            I was afraid that she would give up. I quickly said more details, “I’m going to write to her and tell her what happened to me, and ask her what would happen if she was in my situation, and there is something that I was planning
                            to tell her when we meet. What about you gonna write?" Mother seems to be awakened, I guess she finally thought of what to write, but she said impatiently, "I know, I know, you can just write it yourself. Don't bother me by
                            talking"
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I glanced at her secretly and saw her writing quickly; I smiled secretly to relax and started to write my own letter to grandma. When I put down the pen after writing more than two pages eloquently, I turned my head and saw that my mother was still writing
                            with a focused expression of sorrow. I hurriedly lowered my head and pretended to continue writing for fear of interrupting her emotions. Hearing her rustling writing stop, I turned my head after a while and stretched out and
                            said to her, "I'm finished.", “Yep” Mom answered me, indicating that she had finished writing as well. I asked, "Can you show it to me?" As I have expected, mom said, "You show no respect for your elders! this is for your grandma!"
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            So I said "okay, then let's go and burn it for grandma." So I walked to the altar of grandma with my mother. I picked up my letter, folded it and lit it, and then my mother did the same. We watched the letter we just wrote burn to ashes in the incense
                            burner. The letter only burned for a short time, but it took a long time for my mother to stare at the photo of grandma on the altar. There are many complex emotions in her eyes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            After a long time. She said to me softly, "Let's go". Then she stayed in her own room all afternoon. When she came out at night, she obviously looked a lot more relaxed, and even smiled at me after a long absence.
                        </p>

                            The first person I found was of course my aunt. Auntie and I grew up together, so it will be easier for us to open up this relatively sensitive topic.

                        <p class="desc">
                            I first asked her if she knew anything about grandpa. She said, "Of course I do. I'll tell you what you want to hear. Just don't tell your mother." I said "Of course, but why didn't you tell me before?" She said, "Because your grandma's still alive. What
                            if one of your children makes her sick by talking nonsense in front of your grandma, what should we do? We discussed and reached an agreement of not telling this to children in your generation." I said, "No wonder, then you
                            hurry up. Tell me that story, I’ve been waiting for a long time!” She smiled and responded, “Oh, you are so impatient, let’s talk about it now.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">

                            It turned out that both grandma and grandpa were sent to Qinghai during the Cultural Revolution. Grandma was sent from Xi'an and grandpa from Shanxi to Qinghai to support production. Qinghai is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the
                            least developed places in China. The place where they were assigned was the Qinghai Foundry. At that time, China made every effort to develop the secondary industry. The foundry was a product of the times. At that time, the
                            Qinghai Foundry was like other state-owned factories, located in relatively remote areas and dozens of kilometers away from the nearest town. Basically, all the workers needed for their daily lives can be solved in the factory
                            area, which can be said to be a community where every member has close relationships.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Grandma was an accountant at the only shop in the factory at that time. She was superb with abacus and won first place in the factory's abacus contest. According to my mother, my beautiful and capable grandma who was single at that time could be said
                            to be in the limelight that no one can compare for a while. Grandpa was a very diligent person, from the production team member became the production team leader then to the production director, he was also considered a rare
                            young talent in the factory at that period. At that time, my grandmother's leader saw that they were very suitable, and they were both almost at the age of marriage, so he introduced them to each other. They hit it off and
                            got married in less than a year. After marriage, grandma gave birth to four children including my mother and aunt.

                            Aunt has always been a little overlord, and she doesn't want to study hard. Every day, she brings a bunch of children from the production team under the supervision of grandpa to play pranks everywhere. Aunt said that one of the things she was most proud
                            of was that she used a toothpick to plug the keyhole of school the night before the final exam. The next day the principal came to open the door and found the toothpick inside, and immediately shouted, "Chang Rong!!! You come
                            out and open the door!!" , auntie smiled triumphantly when she talked about it, saying that the principal was so frightened by her, and this time the principal was so angry.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            She played truant almost every day, except for going home obediently for lunch at noon, and doing evil stuff with her little gang outside. She either stole the bacon that was hanging outside of someone’s house or deflated someone’s bicycle tires. She
                            didn’t have any troubles and was just happy day by day.

                        <p class="desc">
                            Until one day, my aunt heard from her little gang secretly talking about the unclear relationship between my grandpa and a production team member in their office. She was so angry that she beat the two gossipers. But she kept hearing it afterwards, until
                            the gossip finally reached my grandma's ears after they spread throughout the factory. Grandma has a strong personality, of course, she would not sit still. On the day she heard the news, she rushed to grandpa’s office, caught
                            my grandpa and the female production team member, scolding them, and went to the factory director’s office and then found the factory director to complain about grandpa’s shameless behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Auntie gritted her teeth when she said this. She said that my grandfather and that woman were really shameless and made my grandma so sad. She remembered my grandma, a proud and stubborn person, her face in tears every night because of this incident.
                            As a little overlord, she thinks she has the responsibility to seek justice for grandma. As a child, she had no other way, but when she saw grandma sad and crying another time, she couldn't hold her anger anymore. She chased
                            grandfather all over the factory with a kitchen knife, and asked him to hurry up and leave that woman, and give grandma an explanation. But obviously this action didn't change my grandfather's mind. He was still shouting at
                            my aunt at this time, "When I die, I will burn everything out, I won’t leave you a penny!!" Aunt must have been very impressed by this sentence. When she told the story, she imitated the tone of the grandfather at the time
                            with gritted teeth. But after about half a year, my grandma's gaze towards grandpa became more and more hostile, and the relationship between grandpa and his colleague grew deeper. One day, they probably had a discussion. Grandpa
                            and the colleague eloped. They left far away, went to Beijing, and threw all the children, responsibilities and pressures to grandma without any communication.

                            Everyone in the factory knows the whole story, and the gaze towards grandma is mixed with sympathy and gloat. This kind of public opinion pressure suddenly fell on grandma. Moreover, the four children who hadn't been taken care of before were still counting
                            on her, she had no experience. The collapse in her heart can be imagined. Seeing such a scene, aunt had to call mother who had already gone to school in the field. My mother hurried home when she received the call from aunt,
                            when she came back home, she only saw her mentally broken grandma and three younger brothers and sisters who were at a loss.
                        </p>

                            Fortunately, my mother is a very strong person. She did not evade responsibility but was thinking about how to solve the problem. First, she took her grandma to a nearby hospital for testing. The hospital said that her grandmother had schizophrenia and
                            needed to be hospitalized. So my mother endured her grief and took her grandma back to the city where she went to school, and placed her in a nearby mental hospital to visit her every weekend. In the next few years, only the
                            eldest aunt was admitted to the university. Aunts and uncles did not study well since they were young, and it was always because grandpa was a leader in the factory, and the position at that time could be passed on to his children.
                            They had been waiting for grandpa’s work arrangement for them so they have never made any other plans for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            In the days when my grandma and grandpa were not there, my uncle and auntie became the only ones that they could depend on each other in the entire foundry. Those who were polite and greeted with their smiling faces became disgusting. People ridiculed
                            them, and the little friends who had played best with aunt were gradually estranged from her under the persuasion of his parents. And she also watched that my uncle, who had planned to succeed as the leader, was forced out
                            of the factory by the leadership of the factory to the position of the smelting worker with the worst environment. He was very tired from work every day, and his hair was scorched, and his face was densely covered with small
                            pits burned out by ashes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            After the aunt's persuasion, my uncle who was unwilling to show weakness to others finally called mother and asked her for help. He said that because grandfather ran away, the people in the factory bullied him and his aunt. The work arranged for him was
                            the most painful and tiring work of smelting. He could hardly stand it anymore. And hope my mother can help him. My mother immediately left and returned to Qinghai. After seeing her uncle's tragic situation, she used a lot
                            of effort to help him find a job in the city where she was studying. Fortunately, the state-owned factory was already withering at this time, so there was no energy to stop this from happening. My aunt was also taken by mother
                            to be taken care of.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            At this time, my grandma had been in a mental hospital for a long time, and her condition had gradually been brought under control. No more babbling words, no more smashing things. It's just that she began to be silent for a long time. Only when her children
                            are visiting, will she speak normally, and she is unwilling to communicate with others.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            After many more years, when mother finally had enough income, she bought a small two-bedroom apartment for grandma to live in. Because my mother had always been renting an apartment before and changed places due to various reasons, she was afraid that
                            frequent changes of the environment would adversely stimulate grandma's condition. Only then the place of stories in my memory happens.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            The story ends here. As a feminist, I naturally sigh at my grandma's experience. It was the grandfather who had an ambiguous relationship with others and eloped with another without any responsibility at all without saying a word. In my opinion, this
                            behavior is simply unacceptable. Obviously, my aunt held the same view as me, so we fought against Grandpa's behavior for a long time. How did you do that? Did you encounter him? Or was it your feelings that were so difficult?
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I am very happy to have such an ally who is willing to exchange "secret information" with me. Of course, I have to ask all the doubts that have been trapped in my heart over the years, so I asked, "Oh right, why does grandma keep smoking Cat cigarettes?
                            "My aunt said, "I remember that when I was a child, your grandpa brought us a black cat. We kept it. It was especially good at catching mice, so we called it a Goodcat. After a few years, Goodcat ate a rat which had eaten rat
                            poison. So Goodcat was also poisoned to death. Maybe your grandma missed that day very much." I nodded. It turned out to be the case. I then asked, "Then why did she say that Chairman Mao is coming back at five o'clock?" My
                            aunt sighed, "Your grandfather gets off work at five o'clock, and his work place is really close to home, so every time it's almost a few minutes he can go home. Your grandma is probably waiting for him. When your grandpa was
                            young, he was always said to look like Chairman Mao, saying that he would do great things in the future. It seems one of the reasons why your grandma chose him as husband."
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            Yes, although I have not lived in their era, I can imagine that people at that time probably had a deep worship for Chairman Mao. Grandma might think that people who looked like Chairman Mao would be very powerful as well.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            All the mysteries have been solved. I used to have all kinds of ideas, but I didn't expect the answer to be so empty and heavy. Empty because love is something that was uncontrollable but it could hurt people so badly. Heavy because grandma destroyed
                            most of her life because of another person's mistake.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I found my mother and told her that I knew the story of grandma and grandpa. I think she guessed who told me, even though my aunt and I said not to tell my mother that it was she. But I am sure that my mother will not blame my aunt for this matter. I
                            can see that she finds it difficult to tell, but she should not feel that I have no right to know about this. I told my mother the information I have got, and my mother added some missing points for me from her perspective.
                            I think this is also a rare experience for my mother just like me, because there are many things that she had only vague impressions of, but under my retelling, she gradually remembered a lot of details, and also came up with
                            many points that could only be discovered afterwards. We talked for a long time that night. Not only about grandma, but also about feelings, about life. I think that night, my mother and I both grew up a little bit.

                            To this day, grandma has been gone for about half a year but I feel my life is so different that as if a generation has passed. Life is still going on, both me and my family are aware of this. We are all gradually able to experience happiness and pleasure,
                            and things seem to gradually return to normal.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            But, I know that there is always a small corner in my heart where grandma lives. She stopped smoking in that corner, and welcomed her Chairman Mao. She was still the champion of abacus that everyone praised in the factory, she was still proud, always
                            face up and smiling. There was sunlight pouring down on her; the black mist surrounding her seemed to have never existed, and her eyes were clear and bright.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            She no longer feels sorrowful and pushes away those who love her. No longer thinking in day and night, sinking into the past that can't go back.
                        </p>
                        <p class="desc">
                            I know that she is living very well in that corner of my heart now, because she always appears naughty in my dreams. She jumps out to say hello to me and then continues to run towards the sun, all the shadows left far behind by her.
