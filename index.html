		<div>You Yuan</div>
		<div>I am , a 22-year-old young Chinese woman, But you can call me , this is the name that I took for myself, it represents the beginning of everything, the start point. I took this name for myself because I hope that I can always keep my heart and be myself. 
</div>
		<div>Next
</div>
		<div>When I was very young, from the beginning of my memory, I lived with my aunt and grandma. My mother often stayed in the field because of work, and my dad didn't know why, he didn't want to take me with him even though we live in the same city. But how my dad treated me didn't matter to me when I was young. Because my grandmother gave me care and love, and my aunt gave me company and fun. I thought that’s enough for me.
</div>
		<div>After a long time, until the light outside the window changed from light yellow like scrambled eggs to orange like sausage, I finally waited for my One Hundred and One Dalmatians. In the sunset, I was angry because the bad woman was going to bully the dog again. I was so angry that I rolled around on the ground. My grandma helped me up and told me that it was just a story. In fact, dogs are so cute so everyone loves dogs. No one is going to bully any of them. I thought : yeah, that makes sense, then I never feel angry anymore because I believe in my grandma.
</div>
		<div>The earliest picture in my memory is that I finished my meal every afternoon around five thirty, and grabbed the small bench and sat to wait for the TV to broadcast the cartoon channel. My auntie hadn’t got off work yet, and my grandma grabbed another small bench to sit just next to me to accompany me. we wait together.
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>In fact, my aunt still has a lot of discipline in me, but my grandmother totally spoiled  me, and feels that I should be spoiled no matter what I do, even if what I do is self-willed and naive from an adult's point of view.
</div>
		<div>be buried in her arms and let my mom go.
</div>
		<div>
Once, because my mother, whom I had not seen for a long time, was on a business trip again, I couldn't stop crying, hoping she would stay. Grandma knew that she had to go because of work, so grandma could only hug me, let my head
</div>
		<div>The soup was so full that it was about to overflow the rim of the bowl, so she held the porcelain bowl with both hands and looked at the bowl to ensure the balance of it, and moved her feet to me in small steps, saying, "Hurry up, baby, come your favorite instant noodles!". then I took a look. Although I was really hungry, the instant noodles smelled so good, and a white and tender poached egg was looming in the soup.
</div>
		<div>Sighed
</div>
		<div>Fortunately, it was winter, and my grandmother didn't get burned while wearing thick cotton clothes. She looked at the mess on the ground, but had no complaint. She just and said: I will make you another one.  
I watched and felt so guilty, but I still couldn't apologize and help. I had no choice but to remain silent, watching her crouching and rushing back and forth just because of my silly and strange pride that comes nowhere.

</div>
		<div>She quietly cleaned up the broken tiles and leftovers on the ground.
</div>
		<div>After going to elementary school, I was picked up by my parents to live with them. Because of young and good health, my aunt often comes to play with me at my house, and often pulls me out to listen to concerts and play bowling and lots of other activities. But grandma is not willing to leave the apartment, not only because of her bad health, but also for other reasons. She is really reluctant to go out. She usually relies on my aunt to buy food and cook, and she hardly goes out.
</div>
		<div>In my memory, she was forced by my mother to travel out of our province with all of us only twice, and she would resist in every way before the journey started, and even cursed my mother and my aunt who wanted to take her out for fun. In the process of traveling, although she has a bad face most of the time, even when taking pictures, I can feel that sometimes she will be unusually happy. She still behaves very upset, but I can feel that she is actually a little happy from her eyes and attitudes ---- I guess she might suppress her true emotions for the sake of pride like what I did when I kicked the noodle when I was a kid.  
</div>
		<div> In my impression, the one action that she always does is to sit in the corner of the sofa and smoke slowly. She must smoke a cigarette brand called "Good Cat". The cigarette box is dark blue with its logo and name printed on it with golden embossing technique. Its logo is very cute. It's a cat. When I was a kid, I didn't have much entertainment except cartoons every afternoon. I often stroked the logo and imagined what kind of cat it was.
</div>
		<div>My grandma is so addicted to cigarettes, sitting there every day, looking at the air in a daze, her eyes are loose, just smoking one by one. With twenty per pack of "Good Cat" cigarettes, she can smoke more than one pack a day. In the corner where my grandma often sits, the ceiling and the wall next to her have been smoked to dark brown color. The color spreads around the corner where she is, gradually spreading to light yellow. At that time in my eyes, she was someone who was holding the cigarette and being surrounded by a layer of black mist. The mist seemed to come from all corners of the world, wrapping her around, holding her tightly, so that she had to sit there and couldn’t move.
</div>
		<div>But there was a moment that allowed her some free time from the black mist. Whenever the hand of the watch is about to point to five o'clock, grandma will stand up and stare at the watch, her right hand holding the cigarette is hanging in the air, her left hand is in the waist, her face is motionless and nervous, her eyes are big and muddy. Staring at the watch as if staring at the prey, It seems to have cast a holding spell. And when the minute hand finally pointed to twelve, she would suddenly raise her hands above her head with a genuine smile on her face and shout, "Chairman Mao is back! Chairman Mao is back!!" It was like a weird ritual.
</div>
		<div>As a young girl, I think this behavior is a bit weird, but I have limited cognition so I can't say anything wrong from it. I get used to it over time. Then grandma looked at the door with a big smile, I don't know what she was waiting for, maybe she was waiting for "Chairman Mao". But after a while, she seemed to realize something, and gradually put her smile away, and her eyelids drooped again to cover the light that was rarely seen just now. "Huh, he is not a good thing." I often hear her say this. I sat on the small bench next to the TV and watched her sitting back on the corner of the sofa, continuing to smoke, breathing in the dark mist, and sinking into the dark room.
</div>
		<div>Frankly speaking, grandma has mental illness. This is something that should not be told to others in our culture. This is the information I got from the conversations between my family and relatives. When I was ignited and curious and wanted to inquire further, I was always scolded, "You kid, don't ask this!" Then they would turn around their talking bluntly, or being silent for a long time. The heavy and solemn atmosphere they exude at this moment made me feel breathless. Although I have always been curious, I never dared to ask anymore, as if my inquiry would lead to any serious consequences, and as if I was searching for an incredible secret.
</div>
		<div>I enjoy the joy of youth and the tension brought by deadlines, but these days, I rarely think of my home. I rarely call home, even though I already have a video call function on my phone at that time. Every time my mother or my aunt calls me after cautiously calculating the jet lag, I always feel that they are delaying me and just hang up after a few rounds.  Even various holidays are filled with internships and travels with friends, and I only went home twice within five years during bachelor life.
</div>
		<div> I was dragged by my mother to see my grandma during those two periods of homecoming. To me, she seems to be a person far away from my life at that time. We are separated by the river of time. I can see her but I don't want to cross the river.
</div>
		<div>When I grew up, I didn't know how to be ignorant anymore. I realized that she was really a bit strange, but as for the reason? I didn't have access to explore it and didn't want to dig into it. I thought, "It doesn't matter, my life can be without her story anyway".
</div>
		<div>In the two meetings with her, she still acts like what I have remembered, smoking a "good cat" cigarette in the corner of the sofa. Only glanced up at us when we greeted her and then she lowered her head and stared at the floor again, then never moved. 
</div>
		<div>At this time, my auntie was married and moved into a new house with her husband. Only my grandmother lived in this old apartment. The apartment that has existed for more than 30 years and it is a bit dilapidated, and even the smokiness on the wall and ceiling in my impression is deeper, darker, and the darkest areas are even a little shiny. My grandma in this mist also seemed to be darker, her whole person huddled and curled up as if being sucked by the black mist.
</div>
		<div>
When my mother and my aunt talked a lot for a long time, trying to let her join the conversation but failed --- my grandma didn’t respond. My mother and my aunt had to leave taking me. Before stepping out of the door, I turned my head and looked at her, her face was in the smoke. The blurry and distortion because of the smoke made me hardly see clearly, only her muddy eyes were still looking at a point near me, expressing confusion and sadness.
</div>
		<div>And that was the last time I saw her.
</div>
		<div>phase1 denial
</div>
		<div>In March 2020, I was panicked because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic in the United States. In New York, I have no intention of doing anything every day. I only keep refreshing the real-time data of New York diagnoses on the Internet. I don’t want to go to school but I have to because the school does not have any policies on this yet and I want to graduate. Because of my family's advice and the severe domestic epidemic situation in China, I dare not go out without wearing a mask. On the train, every time I wear a mask, I receive some unfriendly eyes.
</div>
		<div>
I was very impressed one day. That night, I was still anxious and tired after a  class and set off to take the PATH TRAIN back to my apartment in Jersey City. On the train, I was scolded for wearing a mask by a big guy. What he said was terrible. At the time, I didn't dare to refute or cause conflict in a foreign country. In order not to let him see my cowardice, I had to put my head down, pretending that I didn't understand what he said. I think he can actually tell that I can understand, so he keeps talking, but I really can't think of any other way to deal with such a situation.
</div>
		<div>Listening to his harsh words along the way, my tears rolled in my eyes, my head buzzed, my hands in my clothes pockets clenched into fists, my nails were deep in the flesh, and it hurts, but these pains also helped me won’t let the tears fall. He is a very strong man. He stood opposite me and said excitedly. With my head down, I could only see his chest. The carriage was very quiet, except for his voice and the sound of the ding-ding-dong subway running. I secretly glanced at the people nearby, and everyone looked like nothing happened, just seeing straight. so I had to look at the ground again.
</div>
		<div>The journey that day was exceptionally long, so long that I felt that there was a long interval between my breaths. Amid his verbal abuse, I thought of the loneliness I felt during the time I came to New York. Every day I spent a long commute to and from school by myself. There are a lot of things that I have never encountered before in terms of academics, and lots of inconvenience in life. The scenes hovered in my mind, making me feel so depressed. I tried to keep my eyes open widely, trying to evaporate some tears by this way, but the tears still accumulated more and more. Fortunately, the car door opened, and I turned my head and flew away from the train. I was afraid that the man would catch me up.
</div>
		<div>Fortunately, he probably just wanted to scold me along the way back home and didn't intend to catch up to me. When I ran, I seemed to hear his disdainful laugh. But anyway, I finally escaped the terrible scene. I took a long breath and dragged heavy steps back to the apartment. After greeting my roommate with a smile like usual, I went back to my room and closed the door, lying weakly on the bed in a daze. There is no light on the ceiling. I only bought a small lamp in order to save money. Even if the lamp is turned on at night, the room is still dim. The gray ceiling in my eyes while lying on the bed gradually became blurry. And I stayed in this vague vision for a long time, and my consciousness began to blur as well, not knowing the passage of time, until I was interrupted by the ringtone of the mobile phone.
</div>
		<div>It was my mother's video call. I looked at the screen and suddenly realized that she hadn't called me on video for a long time. I quickly took a deep breath and took some napkins to wipe away my tears, changed into a nonchalant look and clicked accept, "Oh, what's the matter, you haven’t called me for a long time, I thought you already forgot your kid?" I joked. But my mom didn’t laugh because of the joke. She said with a solemn expression different from the past, "Jiaxin, grandma passed away". I asked "Ah? What's going on? Why?" She didn't answer my question. She just said that she is very busy now and there are a lot of things to deal with. She just informs me of the fact now, she will tell me more detail when she gets any chance. She asked me if I want to consider returning to China for my grandma. After that, she hung up. 
</div>
		<div>I released the phone and started looking at the ceiling in a daze---and this time seemed more dazed than before. After a long time, my vision became blurred again, and at this time, I felt as if something was pressed against my chest, making me want to scream and release. I thought, where can I let myself cry?
</div>
		<div> Now my roommate is at home, so I must not cry in the room, and although this apartment is newly built, the soundproofing is very poor, and the sound of cooking next door can often be heard. If I cry loudly, it will disturb the neighbors next door. The Common Room in the building is obviously not a good choice. If crying outside the apartment, will I be scolded again or even beaten? And is there a chance to  get the virus if I take off the mask when crying? and If I cry on the street, I’m going to disturb others..... I thought about it and found that I couldn’t find any place to let me relax and release my emotions. My roommate was watching the TV show loudly next door, and the laughter from time to time poured into my ears. I had to open my mouth and scream silently in her laughter, like a goldfish falling on the ground, staring to a point, open mouth as big as I can and try to catch a little bit of oxygen for survival.
</div>
		<div> I was too tired because of crying, then I just fell asleep. When I woke up the next day, I felt that my sanity had recovered a bit, and I could finally start thinking and reasoning. Yesterday my mother said that my grandma had passed away. Is this true? What is the situation like? I really want to know what's going on. But yesterday I felt  my mother was very stressed, so I dare not stimulate her anymore. Although the relationship between me and my father has always been estranged, maybe he is the most suitable choice for me to ask at this moment.
</div>
		<div>
So I sent him a message and asked him, "My mother said that my grandma passed away yesterday, is it true?" He only replied with a few words "It is true, we are in the hospital,will you come back?" For a while, I was a little confused. I can't believe it, this is the first time I have encountered the death of someone close to me. The hand holding the phone began to tremble, and I think the voice was a little trembling as well. I recorded the voice note and asked him if he was lying, but before I finished that voice message, I cried out and cancelled that message. I realize it must be true, they won’t take this kind of serious thing as a joke, I don’t want to cheat myself anymore.
</div>
		<div>I found grandma’s WeChat account --- my mother once registered a WeChat account for grandma and added a group of friends and relatives, and repeatedly taught grandma how to use it (though I think grandma probably never listened to it), and told her that it is a good way to  using this to contact others. The chatting box between me and her was empty, no message was displayed. I looked at this empty dialog box, and suddenly had the urge to send a message to my grandma. Why? Actually, I didn’t know it myself. I posted, "Grandma, long time no see, I’ve had a hard time recently, how about you?" I didn’t want to read it again after sending this message, so I hurriedly turned off the phone, as if I was running away.
</div>
		<div>After a short period of thought, I decided to go home. Even if I found that it was difficult to buy a ticket to return to my country, even if the ticket cost was almost ten times more expensive than usual and I had to be quarantined after returning to my country, I did not change my mind. 
</div>
		<div>Finally, I bought a flight ticket from New York to Tokyo, Japan back to Xiamen in five days. After the quarantine, I still need to fly back to my home city for another quarantine. I was very excited that I finally grabbed the possibility of going home after a long time refreshing the official flight websites. After getting the flight order confirmation, I couldn’t wait to take out my mobile phone and send WeChat to my grandma, “Grandma, I’m coming back soon!!” Strangely speaking, I didn’t think of my grandma very often before her death, and she was not someone I wanted to share happiness with at first moment, but this time, the person I wanted to tell the good news to was her. Perhaps I think of her so frequently these days so I have deepened my connection with her. 
</div>
		<div>The rest of the day passed in a muddle-headed manner. There was nothing in my mind, but a step-by-step implementation according to the plan. I felt like my body was light and fluttering like cotton, and my head was stuffy as if it was wrapped in a plastic bag. Even the voices from the outside world heard deep echoes in my ears. I didn’t cry anymore, I just felt that I lost my ability to perceive emotions. The upheaval of the journey and the long isolation did not tear the plastic bag that wrapped me until I returned to my familiar home after a long time. The plastic bag was pulled by the warm atmosphere of home, tearing a hole for me to breathe. Colors and sounds gradually emerged in my originally silent mind. 
</div>
		<div>It was my aunt who came to pick me up. She said that my mother was thinking of picking me up, but she saw that my mother was not in a good mood and didn't take much rest, so she said she would pick me up instead. Although she said that, I saw her dark circles under her eyes and drooping eyebrows, I knew that she might not be very well either. 
</div>
		<div>When I got home, it was already evening, and she said I should take a good bath and rest for the night and she will pick me up for the funeral tomorrow morning. After an exhortation, she helped me unpack my luggage, then she went back to the funeral parlor to help. 
</div>
		<div>Button</div>
		<div>That night, I lay alone in the huge house tossing and turning：
</div>
		<div> I walked out to the balcony and looked at the stars in the sky
</div>
		<div>Get out of
Dark
</div>
		<div>It was a long time after my mother left that she finally let me go. I felt so uncomfortable and hated her for preventing me from going to my mother, so I kept using all my strength to kick her and beat her. She didn't fight back, but looked at me sad and worried with her gentle and cloudy eyes, worried that my mother's departure would bring me too much shock. I have been crying for a long, long time, and finally I leaned on the radiator and . Seeing that I was too weak to cry, my grandmother went to the kitchen and made me a big bowl of instant noodles  (she can't cook, only serves instant noodles).
</div>
		<div>sobbed</div>
		<div>However, I thought in my mind: I'm still angry! Does she think I will not be angry anymore just because of this temptation! Why does she despise my anger, my anger is so great!”  Thinking of this, I kicked over the bowl in my grandma's hands. It spilled into grandma's arms and then scattered all over the place.
</div>
		<div>I graduated from high school and received an acceptance letter from the United States. At the age of 17, I embarked on an unknown journey alone. No one was by my side. But I felt that I was a lonely warrior. Although timid, I was more excited and thrilled. When I was in college, I felt that my focus of life gradually shifted to school. I stay with my friends every day, and there are always various clubs and activities on weekends.

Her lumbar spine is very bad that she can only bend over and put her elbows against her thighs to smoke: Although she knows that this will make her condition worse, she still chooses to drink this poison to quench her thirst, in order to take that smoke.
